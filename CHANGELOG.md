# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Restructured documentation hierarchy into nested domain directories under `docs/`.
- Aligned documentation with the current repository structure (auth endpoints, dependency rules, folder tree, API envelope, middleware behavior).
- Deepened documentation to match the reference style: tables, ownership maps, data-flow diagrams, and explicit implemented-vs-planned framing.
- Consolidated overlapping documentation files to reduce count and length (36 files down to 22).
- Added `pnpm docs:check` validation script and pre-commit hook to keep docs in sync with the repo.

### Added
- Delete account flow on the profile page (`useDeleteAccount` + `DeleteAccountButton`, wired to `DELETE /api/v1/auth/account`).
- Verification harness: `verify:fast`/`verify`/`verify:all` scripts, risk classification (`verify:risk`), and cross-repo sync check (`verify:cross-repo`).
- GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): lint, type-check, docs, build, risk classification.
- Feature documentation gate: new route groups must be documented in `docs/features/<feature>.md` (template enforced by `docs:check`).
- Architecture decision records: ADR-001 (in-memory auth session), ADR-002 (single-flight refresh), ADR-003 (client-side route guards).
- Added the product roadmap and upgraded `docs/product/overview.md` with a product vision section.
- Google SSO (OIDC): "Continue with Google" button on the login form; backend handles the OAuth flow.
- Moved Google OAuth URL out of the component: `googleAuthUrl()` in `src/lib/api/client.ts` + `API_ENDPOINTS.AUTH.GOOGLE`; UI no longer hardcodes the backend URL.
